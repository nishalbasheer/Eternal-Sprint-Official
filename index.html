            <h1>Hi, It's <span>Nishal</span></h1>
            <h3 >Game Designer, Programmer & Developer of Eternal Sprint<span></span></h3>
            <p>Creating Eternal Sprint has been a journey filled with creativity, technical challenges, and endless iterations.
                 I envisioned a game that would be both easy to jump into and hard to put down, and I wanted to ensure every player, 
                 regardless of skill level, could find enjoyment and motivation to keep pushing their high scores. 
                 Developing the game with Unreal Engine 5 for mobile was a unique experience, as I balanced high-quality graphics with smooth performance on various devices.

                Throughout development, I focused on optimizing gameplay mechanics, enhancing performance, and crafting an intuitive user interface. 
                Eternal Sprint’s obstacles and levels were carefully designed to create a dynamic flow, giving players a sense of excitement and progress as they play. 
                Working on this project has deepened my understanding of mobile game optimization, from efficient rendering techniques to frame rate management, 
                and has inspired me to bring even more thrilling features to the game in future updates.

               </p>
               <h3 > Thank you for joining me on this sprinting adventure—I'm excited to see how high you can score! <span></span></h3>
